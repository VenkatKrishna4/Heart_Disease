📌 About This Project  
This project is a **machine learning-based web application** that predicts the risk of **Stroke** and **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)** based on patient health data. The goal is to provide **early risk detection** and help individuals take preventive measures.  

✅ Technologies Used:  
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression  
- Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- Web Framework: Streamlit  
- Deployment: Streamlit Cloud  

⚙️ How It Works  
1. Select the disease type (Stroke or CHF).  
2. Enter the patient’s details (age, gender, blood pressure, glucose level, etc.).  
3. Click on "Predict Risk" to get the result.  
4. The app will show "High Risk"** or "Low Risk" based on the trained model's prediction.
